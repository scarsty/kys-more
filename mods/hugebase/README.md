The codes can be complied with free pascal 3.0.0 under lazarus 1.6, or free pascal 3.1.1 under CodeTyphon for Windows, MacOSX, linux and Android (please see <https://github.com/godka/pig3android> to get more information). 
Another project kys-cpp <https://github.com/scarsty/kys-cpp> is much more strongly recommended.

The external libraries are SDL/SDL-ttf/SDL-image, BASS, FFmpeg, Lua.

Special thanks to JEDI-SDL, UltraStar Deluxe, Open Chinese Convert, and DuanGeXing SoundFonts.

This project is a derivative of kys-pascal (known as kys-jedisdl).

The codes are distributed under zlib license.
